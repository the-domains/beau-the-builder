Every Decibel Matters

My humble beginnings and first creative venture. For as long as I'd been a carpenter I'd always wanted to build a sound system, than miraculously when scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed the opportunity arose, A guy I hardly new needed a carpenter to build some speakers. Needless to say I jumped at the opportunity, and together  we managed to create some beautiful speakers (after a few prototypes) that the world had never seen before.
